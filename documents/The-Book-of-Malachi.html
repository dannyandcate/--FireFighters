        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>THE burden of the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>to Israel by Malachi.</p>
        <p>2 I have loved you, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not Esau Jacob&rsquo;s brother? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob,</p>
        <p>3 And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</p>
        <p>4 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lordhath indignation for ever.</p>
        <p>5 And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will be magnified from the border of Israel.</p>
        <p>6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A son honoureth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>father, and a servant his master: if then I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a father, where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mine honour? and if I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a master, where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my fear? saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?</p>
        <p>7 Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>contemptible.</p>
        <p>8 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
        <p>9 And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
        <p>10 Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span>even among you that would shut the doors<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>nought?</em><span>&nbsp;</span>neither do ye kindle<span>&nbsp;</span><em>fire</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</p>
        <p>11 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great among the heathen, saith the Lordof hosts.</p>
        <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>polluted; and the fruit thereof,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his meat,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>contemptible.</p>
        <p>13 Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it!</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and ye have snuffed at it, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts; and ye brought<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the Lord.</p>
        <p>14 But cursed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a great King, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, and my name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>dreadful among the heathen.</p>

        <h1>The Book of Malachi<br /><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi+2&version=NIV" target="_blank">ðŸ’˜</a> Chapter 2</h1>
        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>AND now, O ye priests, this commandment<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for you.</p>
        <p>2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to heart.</p>
        <p>3 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the dung of your solemn feasts; and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall take you away with it.</p>
        <p>4 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
        <p>5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.</p>
        <p>6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.</p>
        <p>7 For the priest&rsquo;s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the messenger of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
        <p>8 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
        <p>9 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.</p>
        <p>10 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?</p>
        <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.</p>
        <p>12 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
        <p>13 And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with good will at your hand.</p>
        <p>14<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.</p>
        <p>15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.</p>
        <p>16 For the Lord, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>covereth violence with his garment, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.</p>
        <p>17<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ye have wearied the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him?</em><span>&nbsp;</span>When ye say, Every one that doeth evil<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good in the sight of the Lord, and he delighteth in them; or, Where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the God of judgment?</p>

        <h1>The Book of Malachi<br /><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi+3&version=NIV" target="_blank">ðŸ’˜</a> Chapter 3</h1>
        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>BEHOLD, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
        <p>2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like a refiner&rsquo;s fire, and like fullers&rsquo; soap:</p>
        <p>3 And he shall sit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>an offering in righteousness.</p>
        <p>4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years.</p>
        <p>5 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger<span>&nbsp;</span><em>from</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>right</em>, and fear not me, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
        <p>6 For I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.</p>
        <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?</p>
        <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.</p>
        <p>9 Ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this whole nation.</p>
        <p>10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>room</em><span>&nbsp;</span>enough<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>receive</em><em>it</em>.</p>
        <p>11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
        <p>12 And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
        <p>13<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Your words have been stout against me, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, What have we spoken<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>much</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against thee?</p>
        <p>14 Ye have said, It<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vain to serve God: and what profit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts?</p>
        <p>15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>tempt God are even delivered.</p>
        <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then they that feared the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake often one to another: and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hearkened, and heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.</p>
        <p>17 And they shall be mine, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.</p>
        <p>18 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.</p>

        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>FOR, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.</p>
        <p>2<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.</p>
        <p>3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em>, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
        <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the statutes and judgments.</p>
        <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord:</p>
        <p>6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</p>
