        <p class="center"></p>
        <p><span>THE burden of Nineveh.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.</span></p>
        <p>2 God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>jealous, and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>revengeth; the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>revengeth, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>furious; the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>wrath</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for his enemies.</p>
        <p>3 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>wicked:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>hath</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the dust of his feet.</p>
        <p>4 He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.</p>
        <p>5 The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.</p>
        <p>6 Who can stand before his indignation?<span>&nbsp;</span><span>and</span><span>&nbsp;</span>who can abide in the fierceness of his anger?<span>&nbsp;</span><span>his</span><span>&nbsp;</span>fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</p>
        <p>7 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.</p>
        <p>8 But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.</p>
        <p>9 What do ye imagine against the Lord?<span>&nbsp;</span><span>he</span><span>&nbsp;</span>will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.</p>
        <p>10 For while<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><span><em>be</em></span><span>&nbsp;</span>folden together<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thorns, and while they are drunken<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.</p>
        <p>11 There is<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the Lord, a wicked counseller.</p>
        <p>12 Thus saith the Lord;<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Though</span><span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.</p>
        <p>13 For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.</p>
        <p>14 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath given a commandment concerning thee,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave<span>;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>for thou art vile.</p>
        <p>15 Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good<span>&nbsp;</span><span>tidings, that</span><span>&nbsp;</span>publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.</p>

        <h1>The Book of Nahum<br /><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nahum+2&version=NIV" target="_blank">ðŸ’˜</a> Chapter 2</h1>
        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>HE that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>loins strong,<span>&nbsp;</span><span>fortify</span><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>power mightily.</p>
        <p>2 For the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath turned away the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>excellency</span><span>&nbsp;</span>of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches.</p>
        <p>3 The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in scarlet: the chariots<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.</p>
        <p>4 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.</p>
        <p>5 He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.</p>
        <p>6 The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.</p>
        <p>7 And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead<span>&nbsp;</span><em>her</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.</p>
        <p>8 But Nineveh<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>cry;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>but none shall look back.</p>
        <p>9 Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none end<span>&nbsp;</span><span>of</span><span>&nbsp;</span>the store<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>glory out of all the pleasant furniture.</p>
        <p>10 She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.</p>
        <p>11 Where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the old lion, walked,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the lion&rsquo;s whelp, and none made<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>afraid?</p>
        <p>12 The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.</p>
        <p>13 Behold, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against thee, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.</p>

        <h1>The Book of Nahum<br /><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nahum+3&version=NIV" target="_blank">ðŸ’˜</a> Chapter 3</h1>
        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>WOE to the bloody city!<span>&nbsp;</span><span>it</span><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all full of lies<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>robbery; the prey departeth not;</p>
        <p>2 The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots.</p>
        <p>3 The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none end of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:</p>
        <p>4 Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.</p>
        <p>5 Behold, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against thee, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.</p>
        <p>6 And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.</p>
        <p>7 And it shall come to pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her?<span>&nbsp;</span><span>whence</span><span>&nbsp;</span>shall I seek comforters for thee?</p>
        <p>8 Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>had</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the waters round about it, whose rampart<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the sea,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>her wall<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from the sea?</p>
        <p>9 Ethiopia and Egypt<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>her strength, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.</p>
        <p>10 Yet<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.</p>
        <p>11 Thou also shalt be<span>&nbsp;</span><span>drunken</span>: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy.</p>
        <p>12 All thy strong holds<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>like</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they<span>&nbsp;</span><span>be</span><span>&nbsp;</span>shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.</p>
        <p>13 Behold, thy people in the midst of thee<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars.</p>
        <p>14 Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.</p>
        <p>15 There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>cankerworm,</span><span>&nbsp;</span>make thyself many as the locusts.</p>
        <p>16 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away.</p>
        <p>17 Thy crowned<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em>.</p>
        <p>18 Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>dust:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>.</p>
        <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><em>There</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?</p>
