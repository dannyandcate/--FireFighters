        <h1>The Book of Habakkuk<br /><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Habakkuk+1&version=NIV" target="_blank">ðŸ’˜</a> Chapter 1</h1>
        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>THE burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</p>
        <p>2 O Lord, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear!<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cry out unto thee<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>violence, and thou wilt not save!</p>
        <p>3 Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before me: and there are<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>raise up strife and contention.</p>
        <p>4 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</p>
        <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>I</em><span>&nbsp;</span>will work a work in your days,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye will not believe, though it be told<span>&nbsp;</span><em>you</em>.</p>
        <p>6 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not theirs.</p>
        <p>7 They<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</p>
        <p>8 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hasteth to eat.</p>
        <p>9 They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</p>
        <p>10 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</p>
        <p>11 Then shall<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>imputing</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this his power unto his god.</p>
        <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em>Art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou not from everlasting, O Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O Lord, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</p>
        <p>13<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Thou</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>more righteous than he?</p>
        <p>14 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>have</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no ruler over them?</p>
        <p>15 They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</p>
        <p>16 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fat, and their meat plenteous.</p>
        <p>17 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</p>

        <h1>The Book of Habakkuk<br /><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Habakkuk+2&version=NIV" target="_blank">ðŸ’˜</a> Chapter 2</h1>
        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>I WILL stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</p>
        <p>2 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.</p>
        <p>3 For the vision<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</p>
        <p>4 Behold, his soul<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.</p>
        <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:</p>
        <p>6 Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!</p>
        <p>7 Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?</p>
        <p>8 Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men&rsquo;s blood, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</p>
        <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!</p>
        <p>10 Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned<span>&nbsp;</span><em>against</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy soul.</p>
        <p>11 For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</p>
        <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!</p>
        <p>13 Behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?</p>
        <p>14 For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.</p>
        <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em>, and makest<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!</p>
        <p>16 Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the Lord&rsquo;s right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on thy glory.</p>
        <p>17 For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>made them afraid, because of men&rsquo;s blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</p>
        <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?</p>
        <p>19 Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>laid over with gold and silver, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no breath at all in the midst of it.</p>
        <p>20 But the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.</p>

        <h1>The Book of Habakkuk<br /><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Habakkuk+3&version=NIV" target="_blank">ðŸ’˜</a> Chapter 3</h1>
        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>A PRAYER of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.</p>
        <p>2 O Lord, I have heard thy speech,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>was afraid: O Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</p>
        <p>3 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.</p>
        <p>4 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>brightness was as the light; he had horns<span>&nbsp;</span><em>coming</em><span>&nbsp;</span>out of his hand: and there<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the hiding of his power.</p>
        <p>5 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.</p>
        <p>6 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>everlasting.</p>
        <p>7 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</p>
        <p>8 Was the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>displeased against the rivers?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thine anger against the rivers?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy chariots of salvation?</p>
        <p>9 Thy bow was made quite naked,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>according</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the oaths of the tribes,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</p>
        <p>10 The mountains saw thee,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>lifted up his hands on high.</p>
        <p>11 The sun<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at the shining of thy glittering spear.</p>
        <p>12 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.</p>
        <p>13 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.</p>
        <p>14 Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as to devour the poor secretly.</p>
        <p>15 Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>through</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the heap of great waters.</p>
        <p>16 When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.</p>
        <p>17<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fruit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no herd in the stalls:</p>
        <p>18 Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</p>
        <p>19 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds&rsquo;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>feet</em>, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.</p>
