        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</p>
        <p>2 To Timothy,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
        <p>3 I thank God, whom I serve from<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</p>
        <p>4 Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p>
        <p>5 When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</p>
        <p>6 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</p>
        <p>7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</p>
        <p>8 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</p>
        <p>9 Who hath saved us, and called<span>&nbsp;</span><em>us</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</p>
        <p>10 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</p>
        <p>11 Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</p>
        <p>12 For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</p>
        <p>13 Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
        <p>14 That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</p>
        <p>15 This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</p>
        <p>16 The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</p>
        <p>17 But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em>.</p>
        <p>18 The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</p>

        <h1>The Second Epistle of Paul to Timothy<br /><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+2&version=NIV" target="_blank">ðŸ’˜</a> Chapter 2</h1>
        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>THOU therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
        <p>2 And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>
        <p>3 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>4 No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span>life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</p>
        <p>5 And if a man also strive for masteries,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</p>
        <p>6 The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</p>
        <p>7 Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</p>
        <p>8 Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</p>
        <p>9 Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</p>
        <p>10 Therefore I endure all things for the elect&rsquo;s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
        <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a faithful saying: For if we be dead with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em>, we shall also live with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him:</em></p>
        <p>12 If we suffer, we shall also reign with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>if we deny<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em>, he also will deny us:</p>
        <p>13 If we believe not,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</p>
        <p>14 Of these things put<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in remembrance, charging<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the subverting of the hearers.</p>
        <p>15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>
        <p>16 But shun profane<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</p>
        <p>17 And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymen&aelig;us and Philetus;</p>
        <p>18 Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</p>
        <p>19 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</p>
        <p>20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</p>
        <p>21 If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master&rsquo;s use,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>prepared unto every good work.</p>
        <p>22 Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
        <p>23 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</p>
        <p>24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em>, apt to teach, patient,</p>
        <p>25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</p>
        <p>26 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</p>

        <h1>The Second Epistle of Paul to Timothy<br /><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+3&version=NIV" target="_blank">ðŸ’˜</a> Chapter 3</h1>
        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>THIS know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</p>
        <p>2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>
        <p>3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</p>
        <p>4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</p>
        <p>5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</p>
        <p>6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</p>
        <p>7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
        <p>8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>
        <p>9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em>, as theirs also was.</p>
        <p>10 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</p>
        <p>11 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all the Lord delivered me.</p>
        <p>12 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p>
        <p>13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</p>
        <p>14 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them;</em></p>
        <p>15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
        <p>16 All scripture<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>given by inspiration of God, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</p>
        <p>17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</p>


        <a id="CHAPTER_4"></a>
        <h1>The Second Epistle of Paul to Timothy<br /><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+4&version=NIV" target="_blank">ðŸ’˜</a> Chapter 4</h1>
        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>I CHARGE<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thee</em><span>&nbsp;</span>therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</p>
        <p>2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</p>
        <p>3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</p>
        <p>4 And they shall turn away<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</p>
        <p>5 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</p>
        <p>6 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</p>
        <p>7 I have fought a good fight, I have finished<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>course, I have kept the faith:</p>
        <p>8 Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</p>
        <p>9 Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</p>
        <p>10 For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</p>
        <p>11 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</p>
        <p>12 And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</p>
        <p>13 The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thee</em>, and the books,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>especially the parchments.</p>
        <p>14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</p>
        <p>15 Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</p>
        <p>16 At my first answer no man stood with me, but all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>forsook me:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>I</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>pray</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>God</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that it may not be laid to their charge.</p>
        <p>17 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>
        <p>18 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
        <p>19 Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</p>
        <p>20 Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</p>
        <p>21 Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</p>
        <p>22 The Lord Jesus Christ<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with thy spirit. Grace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with you. Amen.</p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&para; The second<span>&nbsp;</span><em>epistle</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto Timotheus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Ephesians, was written from Rome, when Paul was brought before Nero the second time.</p>
