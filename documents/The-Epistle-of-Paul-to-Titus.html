        <h1>The Epistle of Paul to Titus<br /><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+1&version=NIV" target="_blank">ðŸ’˜</a> Chapter 1</h1>
        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>PAUL, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God&rsquo;s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</p>
        <p>2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began<span>;</span></p>
        <p>3 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</p>
        <p>4 To Titus,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>mine</em><span>&nbsp;</span>own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>
        <p>5 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</p>
        <p>6 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</p>
        <p>7 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p>
        <p>8 But<span>&nbsp;</span><span>a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober</span>, just, holy, temperate;</p>
        <p>9 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</p>
        <p>10 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,<span>&nbsp;</span><span>specially</span><span>&nbsp;</span>they of the circumcision:</p>
        <p>11 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre&rsquo;s sake.</p>
        <p>12 One of themselves,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</p>
        <p>13 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith<span>;</span></p>
        <p>14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</p>
        <p>15 Unto the pure all things<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</p>
        <p>16 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em>, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p>

        <h1>The Epistle of Paul to Titus<br /><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+2&version=NIV" target="_blank">ðŸ’˜</a> Chapter 2</h1>
        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>BUT speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</p>
        <p>2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</p>
        <p>3 The aged women likewise, that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</p>
        <p>4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</p>
        <p>5<span>&nbsp;</span><em>To</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</p>
        <p>6 Young men likewise exhort to be<span>&nbsp;</span><span>sober</span><span>&nbsp;</span>minded.</p>
        <p>7 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shewing</em><span>&nbsp;</span>uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</p>
        <p>8 Sound<span>&nbsp;</span><span>speech</span>, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</p>
        <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Exhort</em><span>&nbsp;</span>servants to be obedient unto their own masters,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to please<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>well in all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not answering again;</p>
        <p><span>10 Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</span></p>
        <p>11 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</p>
        <p>12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</p>
        <p>13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ<span>;</span></p>
        <p>14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good<span>&nbsp;</span><span>works.</span></p>
        <p>15 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</p>

        <h1>The Epistle of Paul to Titus<br /><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+3&version=NIV" target="_blank">ðŸ’˜</a> Chapter 3</h1>
        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>PUT them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</p>
        <p>2 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</p>
        <p>3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hating one another.</p>
        <p>4 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</p>
        <p>5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</p>
        <p>6 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Saviour;</span></p>
        <p>7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
        <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><em>This</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</p>
        <p>9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law<span>;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
        <p>10 A man that is<span>&nbsp;</span><span>an</span><span>&nbsp;</span>heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</p>
        <p>11 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of<span>&nbsp;</span><span>himself</span>.</p>
        <p>12 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus,<span>&nbsp;</span><span>be</span><span>&nbsp;</span>diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</p>
        <p>13 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</p>
        <p>14 And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p>
        <p>15 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace<span>&nbsp;</span><span><em>be</em></span><span>&nbsp;</span>with you all. Amen.</p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&para;It was written to Titus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Cretians, from Nicopolis of Macedonia.</p>
