        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>THE word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>2 Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord God<span>&nbsp;</span>be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.</p>
        <p>3 For, behold, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.</p>
        <p>4 And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as the waters<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>poured down a steep place.</p>
        <p>5 For the transgression of Jacob<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the transgression of Jacob?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not Samaria? and what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the high places of Judah?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not Jerusalem?</p>
        <p>6 Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.</p>
        <p>7 And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.</p>
        <p>8 Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.</p>
        <p>9 For her wound<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Declare ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.</p>
        <p>11 Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel; he shall receive of you his standing.</p>
        <p>12 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto the gate of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>13 O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.</p>
        <p>14 Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a lie to the kings of Israel.</p>
        <p>15 Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.</p>
        <p>16 Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.</p>

        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>WOE to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.</p>
        <p>2 And they covet fields, and take<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by violence; and houses, and take<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</p>
        <p>3 Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>evil.</p>
        <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In that day shall<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.</p>
        <p>5 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the Lord.</p>
        <p>6 Prophesy ye not,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>say</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they shall not take shame.</p>
        <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>O<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thou</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>straitened?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</p>
        <p>8 Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.</p>
        <p>9 The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.</p>
        <p>10 Arise ye, and depart; for this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span>rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>you</em>, even with a sore destruction.</p>
        <p>11 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</p>
        <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>multitude</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>men.</p>
        <p>13 The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>on the head of them.</p>

        <p class="center"></p>
        <p>AND I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not for you to know judgment?</p>
        <p>2 Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;</p>
        <p>3 Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.</p>
        <p>4 Then shall they cry unto the Lord, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.</p>
        <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.</p>
        <p>6 Therefore night<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.</p>
        <p>7 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no answer of God.</p>
        <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the Lord, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.</p>
        <p>9 Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.</p>
        <p>10 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.</p>
        <p>11 The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>among us? none evil can come upon us.</p>
        <p>12 Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.</p>

        <p>BUT in the last days it shall come to pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the mountain of the house of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.</p>
        <p>2 And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lordfrom Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>3<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</p>
        <p>4 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>afraid: for the mouth of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts hath spoken<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
        <p>5 For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God for ever and ever.</p>
        <p>6 In that day, saith the Lord, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;</p>
        <p>7 And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.</p>
        <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>9 Now why dost thou cry out aloud?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no king in thee? is thy counseller perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.</p>
        <p>10 Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.</p>
        <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.</p>
        <p>12 But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.</p>
        <p>13 Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.</p>

        <p>NOW gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.</p>
        <p>2 But thou, Beth-lehem Ephratah,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>though</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou be little among the thousands of Judah,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>out of thee shall he come forth unto me<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>have</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>been</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from of old, from everlasting.</p>
        <p>3 Therefore will he give them up, until the time<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.</p>
        <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.</p>
        <p>5 And this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.</p>
        <p>6 And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver<span>&nbsp;</span><em>us</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.</p>
        <p>7 And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.</p>
        <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.</p>
        <p>9 Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.</p>
        <p>10 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots:</p>
        <p>11 And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds:</p>
        <p>12 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no<span>&nbsp;</span><em>more</em><span>&nbsp;</span>soothsayers:</p>
        <p>13 Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.</p>
        <p>14 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.</p>

        <p>HEAR ye now what the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</p>
        <p>2 Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord&rsquo;s controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.</p>
        <p>3 O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.</p>
        <p>4 For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</p>
        <p>5 O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the Lord.</p>
        <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?</p>

        <p>8 He hath shewed thee, O man, what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good; and what doth the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</p>
        <p>9 The Lord&rsquo;s voice crieth unto the city, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</p>
        <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>abominable?</p>
        <p>11 Shall I count<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?</p>
        <p>12 For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>deceitful in their mouth.</p>
        <p>13 Therefore also will I make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thee</em><span>&nbsp;</span>sick in smiting thee, in making<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thee</em><span>&nbsp;</span>desolate because of thy sins.</p>
        <p>14 Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.</p>
        <p>15 Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.</p>
        <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</p>

        <p>2 The good<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is perished out of the earth: and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.</p>
        <p>3<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge<span>&nbsp;</span><em>asketh</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for a reward; and the great<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em>, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.</p>
        <p>4 The best of them<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as a brier: the most upright<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>sharper</em><span>&nbsp;</span>than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.</p>
        <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.</p>
        <p>6 For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man&rsquo;s enemies<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the men of his own house.</p>
        <p>7 Therefore I will look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.</p>
        <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a light unto me.</p>
        <p>9 I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I shall behold his righteousness.</p>
        <p>10 Then<span>&nbsp;</span><em>she</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mine enemy shall see<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.</p>
        <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><em>In</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the day that thy walls are to be built,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that day shall the decree be far removed.</p>
        <p>12<span>&nbsp;</span><em>In</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that day<span>&nbsp;</span><em>also</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>from</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>from</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mountain to mountain.</p>
        <p>13 Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.</p>
        <p>14<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</p>
        <p>15 According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em>.</p>
        <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hand upon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mouth, their ears shall be deaf.</p>
        <p>17 They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God, and shall fear because of thee.</p>
        <p>18 Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mercy.</p>
        <p>19 He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</p>
        <p>20 Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.</p>
